Instructions for Running the Containerized PostgreSQL Database

1. Prerequisites:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose.
   - Ensure port 5434 is available on your system.

2. Setup:
   - Unzip the project folder.
   - Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.

3. Running the Database:
   - Start the container by running:
         docker-compose up
   - The first run will initialize the database and load the CSV data.
   - To reinitialize (if needed), stop and remove the container with:
         docker-compose down -v
     Then restart with:
         docker-compose up

4. Testing the Database Connection: Using a SQL Client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.):

Host: localhost
Port: 5434
Database: mydatabase
Username: myuser
Password: mypassword

After connecting, run a simple query such as:
SELECT * FROM metrics LIMIT 1;

Using the Command Line:
Run the following command
docker exec -it dsa3101-database-db-1 psql -U myuser -d mydatabase -c "SELECT * FROM metrics LIMIT 1;

5. Connecting to PostgreSQL from Power BI:
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Click on "Get Data" > "More..." > select "Database" and then "PostgreSQL database".
   - In the connection dialog:
         - Server: localhost:5434
         - Port: 5434 (if required, some versions allow specifying this in the Server field as "localhost,5434")
         - Database: mydatabase
   - Click "OK" and enter the credentials:
         - Username: myuser
         - Password: mypassword
   - Once connected, select the tables you want to import and load the data into Power BI.

6. Rename Table Names in Power Query Editor
	1. In the Queries Pane, select the table you want to rename.
	2. Double-click the table name or right-click and choose Rename.
	3. Change the table name according to the required format:
   		- sentiment_analysis → sentiment
		- esg_scoring_results → _Final ESG Score
		- sentiment_analysis_results → _Sentiment
		- esg_extraction_results → _nonnormalized

7. Apply and Close
	1. Click Close & Apply to save changes.
	2. Return to Power BI and ensure the tables are correctly renamed in the Fields pane.

8. Troubleshooting:
   - If you encounter issues, check the logs with:
         docker-compose logs
   - Ensure no other services are using port 5434.

9. Reinitializing the Database (if needed):

To start fresh run :

docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up
