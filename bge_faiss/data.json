Our mission to provide clean, safe, and affordable freedom of mobility to all has never been more important, and the resilience of our colleagues, under the leadership of Carlos Tavares, has made the difference.  \n\nThe story of Stellantis is one of boldness and progress, of always moving forward. We set the course, allocated resources, and strengthened our capabilities in the communities where we are present. This has allowed our 14 American, British, French, German, and Italian iconic brands to continue creating products that customers love and enjoy, while leading the industry in terms of margins and staying on our path toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2038.  \n\nI would like to share the momentum across the entire organization in reaching our carbon neutrality ambition. This year, many teams worked internally and with external partners to develop the most efficient and effective solutions to deliver on our commitments. We will continue to execute our decarbonization strategy to protect our Company, our employees, and generations to come.  \n\nAs part of wider society, Stellantis Foundation, through its philanthropic activities, partnered with CERN to inaugurate the Science Gateway in Geneva, a new emblematic center for science education and outreach. This initiative will allow students and families from around the world to understand the importance of scientific research and its applications, joining education programs that spark innovation and excellence.  \n\nSimultaneously, we continued to champion access and opportunity by supporting talent wherever it resides. In 2023, the Stellantis Student Awards concluded its second global program, celebrating more than 600 family members of Stellantis employees for their dedication to learning.  \n\nEmbracing the diversity of backgrounds and perspectives we will continue to improve Stellantis, as we believe in the value of the dynamic engagement that happens when different ideas collide. The future is full of possibilities, and we are committed to offer the best mobility solutions within the industry. I\u2019m sure that, thanks to the leadership team and to the support of our stakeholders, Stellantis is aiming for a sustainable tomorrow as a great company to work for.  \n\nFebruary 22, 2024   \n$/5/$   \nJohn Elkann   \nChairman",

        "Original": "# MESSAGE FROM THE CEO  \n\nI often use the phrase \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d and in 2023 we doubled down on this mantra. We again demonstrated our ability to execute, to innovate and to transform into a sustainable mobility tech company ready to beat the odds and live its purpose: \u201cPowered by our diversity, we lead the way the world moves.\u201d  \n\nMake no doubt, the enormous transformation happening now in our industry is our opportunity - not a threat \u2013 to shake up the status quo, redefine our destiny, and demonstrate we have the best teams to face fierce competition. We have the people and the mindset, even if we are not always perfect. Dare Forward 2030 is our bold executional roadmap, and on that track, despite the headwinds of all different kinds, we already have some incredible wins under our belt, creating value for our stakeholders.  \n\nAt the end of 2023, nearly one-third of our product portfolio was battery electric, and in 2024 we intend to have an additional 18 BEVs launched, bringing us to 48 electric models total. This product offensive will support the big electrification push in North America and strengthen our European position. Notably, we launched great models like the Citro\u00ebn \u00eb-C3, the most competitively priced B-segment EV produced in Europe, and the Jeep Avenger, which was awarded European Car of the Year 2023, among many other top honors. Plus, we remain neck-and-neck with the current leaders in electric vehicles in our Enlarged Europe region.  \n\nThis year also saw the launch of the first of four all-new, BEV-centric platforms. In July, we presented the STLA Medium benchmark platform debuting it on the Peugeot E-3008, with best-in-class range of up to 700 kilometers (435 miles).  \n\nThe second platform, STLA Large, will be launched this year with 800 kilometers (500 miles) and fitted to exceed customer expectations. STLA Large is a highly flexible, BEV-native platform that will serve as the foundation for upcoming global vehicles in the D and E segments, and able to take multiple propulsion systems, including hybrid and internal combustion.  \n\nTo support our bold electrification ambition, we secured our raw materials needs through 2027 and are on the right pace in battery production. In December 2023, ACC started preliminary production for Stellantis at its Billy-Berclau Douvrin Gigafactory (France) on schedule, paving the way for further industrial developments to meet demand, marked by the start of construction of the second block on the French site, before launching the construction of the first block in Germany and the double block in Italy. The joint venture gigafactories in N.A. are also progressing well with our partners Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution. We also signed a deal with CATL for the supply of lithium iron phosphate battery cells and modules, further expanding our diverse battery chemistry portfolio.  \n\nFlexibility, execution, resilience and agility remain core tenants of the Stellantis mentality and with our several tech and new model announcements the Company is poised to profitably navigate customer demand, market fluctuations and political shifts. In fact, we delivered continued growth outside Enlarged Europe and North America with our \u201cthird engine\u201d delivering a 13 percent increase in Net revenues.  \n\nThis year, we also invested \u20ac1.4 billion in Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co. Ltd (\u201cLeapmotor\u201d), a pure play new energy vehicle original equipment manufacturer (\u201cNEV OEM\u201d), and we now hold approximately 21 percent equity, giving us a leading role in supporting their promising growth in China as well as global expansion opportunities through the new Leapmotor International joint venture for which we will manage. We are actively addressing a white space in our business model and can now benefit from Leapmotor\u2019s competitiveness both in China and abroad.  \n\nBuilding on our growth story, the Stellantis Pro One commercial vehicles team achieved market share leadership in EU30 and South America and is the undisputed leader in EU30 BEV sales with 38.8 percent BEV market share. The business is on track to achieve its objectives with a completely updated and expanded line-up including internal combustion, battery electric, fuel cell hydrogen and range extended variants.  \n\nCritical to our long-term sustainability, we opened our first Circular Economy Hub in Italy to bring together a powerhouse of skills and activities aimed at creating a high-performing center of excellence. Our goal is to industrialize the recovery and sustainable reuse of materials, while building innovative technologies and advanced capabilities, to safeguard our shared future.  \n\nAnd just before the year concluded, we successfully launched our employee share purchase plan \u2013 Shares to Win - in Italy and France and look forward to it being extended to several other countries in 2024.  \n\nImportantly, our record full year 2023 financial results are leading the pack. Net revenues grew 6 percent y-o-y to \u20ac189.5 billion, Net profit rose 11 percent to $\\in18.6$ billion, and industrial free cash flows increased 19 percent y-o-y to $\\in12.9$ billion.  \n\nIn the effort to support a permanent dialogue with external stakeholders, we hosted our first Freedom of Mobility Forum in 2023 on the topic: \u201cIn a decarbonized world, will freedom of mobility be affordable to a happy few only?\u201d. The lively debate reflected the rich diversity in opinions from our esteemed panelists. We are now gearing up for the second annual debate coming on April 3, 2024.  \n\nLast, but certainly not least, I warmly thank all Stellantis employees, our shareholders and the many stakeholders who are supporting our continued success. Of course, there will be little chance to relax in 2024 with challenges coming quick and fast but we remain committed to preserving freedom of mobility. Because this is what Stellantis was made to do.  \n\nThank you.   \nFebruary 22, 2024   \n/s/   \nCarlos Tavares   \nChief Executive Officer  \n\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO SDGS TABLE   \n\n```{table}\n6CSRMACRO-RISKS/ 22CSRISSUES/ PILLARS CHALLENGES, 13 4 15 16 SSS \u71d5 Q\n1.BRINGINGA TANGIBLEIMPACTON CLIMATE CHANGE, [Vehicle CO,emissions Industrial andsitescarbonfootprint]\nII.DRIVINGCOMPANY TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE, Carbonfootprint of the supply chain: purchasing and logistics\n\"\", Managementofcompanytransformation and social dialogue\n\"\", Attracting anddevelopingall talent\nDEVELOPMENTOF HUMAN CAPITAL, Diversity and equal opportunity\n\"\", [Health, safety and well-being in the workplace Developmentofnewmobilitysolutions]\n8 II.MEETING CHANGINGCUSTOMER EXPECTATIONSON 9 MOBILITY 10 Vehicle safety, (including autonomous vehicles)\n\"\", Vehicleandservicequality-customer satisfaction\ninformation, Ethicsingovernance andbusinesspractices\nIV.PREVENTING ETHICSVIOLATION, Responsible management of personal\nV.PROMOTING, Responsibleinformationtocustomers Wiseuse ofmaterialsin the vehicle life cycle\n\"\", (including product recycling) Vehicle impact on air quality\n\"\", \"\"\nPROTECTIONAND Optimization of material cycles in IMPLEMENTING RESPONSIBLE, manufacturing processes (including waste)\nUSEOFNATURAL RESOURCES, Control ofindustrialdischarge andnuisances\nSustainablewatermanagementin manufacturing Protection of biodiversity, \"\"\nVI.ENSURING PROTECTIONOFHUMAN 20 the company's development in host territories, \"\"\nHuman rights in the supply chain Actions to support communities, Responsible purchasing practices to support\nRIGHTSANDSUPPORTING 21 ABALANCEDECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTOF 22 TERRITORIES, \"\"\n```\n\n[Image Description: The image depicts a multi-colored spiral moving along what appears to be a busy roadway at night.

It is based on the double materiality principle which invites companies to report not only on financially material topics that influence their value, but also on economical, environmental and social impacts that the company has on the society. The materiality thresholds have not been defined yet by the Company; they will be set in alignment within the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive timeframe.  \n\nThe CSR risk assessment was the first step in the process: the CSR issues and macro-risks were identified based on the expertise of the network of CSR correspondents and contributors, representing relevant organizations within the Company and on a dialogue with main stakeholders (partners, clients, employees, civil society, financial community and environment groups). In total, 145 organizations representing these stakeholder families have been invited to contribute to the assessment through a survey. Regional assessments were conducted. Stakeholders were identified by both internal experts and by external third party.  \n\nThis materiality assessment allowed us to identify critical economic, environmental and social issues on which Stellantis activities  have impacts (impact materiality) or which have a significant impact on Stellantis business performance and long-term value creation (economic materiality).  \n\nThe result was confirmed by a review of issues reported by industry peers and an analysis of worldwide CSR reference and reporting standards. Stellantis is viewing to update the present Materiality Matrix according to the guidelines published in August 2023.  \n\nA representative sample of stakeholders was then interviewed to ascertain their opinion.  \n\nThen to position the CSR issues on the matrix the structured approach was implemented as follows:  \n\n\u25a0\t the position of the issue on the horizontal axis represents the importance of the CSR issue for the business performance of the Company, according to three criteria:  \n\n\u25cf\t likelihood of the threat (probability of occurrence in short- to medium-term (1-5 years) materializing and opportunities created by the issue   \n\u25cf\t the severity of the impact for the Company, quantified in monetary terms by the Division affected, in case of absence of action. The quantification in monetary terms (\u201coutside-in\u201d perspective) has been considered according to the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) draft standards with the following perspective: \u201cif it triggers financial effects, i.e., generates or may generate significant risks or opportunities that influence or are likely to influence the future cash flows and therefore the enterprise value in the short, medium or long term but are not captured by financial reporting.\u201d   \n\u25cf\t impact on long-term performance, in case of absence of action.  \n\nthe position of the issue on the vertical axis represents how Stellantis activities impact people and planet for each CSR issue, according to stakeholders\u2019 assessment . Survey takers were asked, for each of the 22 CSR issues, to assess the kind of impact Stellantis\u2019 business practices have on the issue (whether positive or negative), the significance of impact of Stellantis on this topic (scale, scope, ability to be remediated) and the likelihood of the impact (short-, medium- and long-term). The score given for each issue by the interviewed and surveyed stakeholders reflect their assessment of the impact the Company can have for each issue.  \n\nAn external provider, a neutral third party, ensured that each issue was scored strictly and fairly using a rigorous methodology, based on the proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) published by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.  The materiality thresholds have not been defined yet by the Company; they will be set in alignment within the European CSRD timeframe. Methodology and matrix have been challenged by external auditors based on available knowledge by the end of 2022.",

        "Original": "# 1.2.3 EXTENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS  \n\n[Image Description: Blue Message Titled TCPCDFF.]  \n\nThe overall Risk Management System of Stellantis integrates the identification and assessment of climate-related risks.  \n\nStellantis uses a group-wide risk analysis framework to assess, manage and report risks, including climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities. All functions are expected to identify and update the risks inherent to their activities. The principal risks in each function, those which are most critical, are analyzed each half year. The enterprise risk assessment is based on a bottom-up approach beginning with functional areas, and concludes with the review by the responsible Chief Operating Officers. The central Risk Management team consolidates results into a report for review and validation with the Top Executive Team.  \n\nStellantis Protection, Audit and Risk Management Department is in charge of assessing the magnitude of the risk as well as the degree of maturity of the risk management measures adopted. The assessment and prioritization process of risks/opportunities, including those posed by climate change, starts with classification of likelihood of the risk occurrence, potential impact on profitability, business continuity and reputation, and mitigation actions in place. These elements determine the residual risk rating defining the risk significance and prioritization for the Company. Risks that are identified as having high- or medium high-ratings are considered significant. The top significant risks, those that might have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the business, are deemed \u201dTop Risks\u201d. Each Top Risk is then classified by risk categories (Strategic, Operational, Financial and Compliance) and control measures and mitigating actions are subsequently defined.  \n\nResults of the risk assessment are submitted to the Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors in their responsibility for strategic oversight of risk management activities. The Audit Committee reviews risk protocols and covers the spectrum of the climate-related physical and transition risks that could have an impact on the Stellantis financial and accounting information. The Board of Directors validates the mapping of Top-Risks.  \n\nStellantis\u2019 risk management system includes action plans and quality indicators, which are audited by the Risk Department of the Company.  \n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) macro risks and issues are also embedded in the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process through interviews of a significant number of managers and top managers. The relevant actions are reflected in the mitigation plans implemented in operational divisions and included in training programs as needed.  \n\n[Image Description: I need a net zero eco screen]",

We protect our sustainable development through responsible decisions and transparent business practices. Our Corporate Social Responsibility policy is based on these fundamental principles:  \n\n\u25a0\t We consider transparency as the basis of\u202fmutual trust with the society. Our responsibility is to make decisions knowing we will be accountable for them in the future. Stellantis strives to publish clear, extensive and accurate information to ensure our stakeholders have access to quality data. As an illustration, we obtain an independent auditor\u2019s opinion on the truthfulness of its content, based on both assurance procedures at corporate (consolidated) level and at site level. Furthermore, the auditors based their selection of sites considering relevant reporting risks and geographical spread. The auditors have conducted their examination  in a manner that allowed them to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to conclude on a reasonable or a limited assurance level for most of the metrics. It also feeds the public debate, for the benefit of the general interest.  \n\n\u25a0\t As data-driven company, we base our decisions on facts, scientific approaches and close monitoring of our activities.  \n\nStellantis regards its CSR policy as a collective and individual endeavor, which ensures that the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility are embedded into each business decision and guides the Company\u2019s approach to its strategic challenges.  \n\nThe CSR commitments presented in this Report are supported by accountable members of the Top Executive Team.

BRINGING A TANGIBLE IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE  \n\nIn the World Economic Forum \u201c2021 Risk Report\u201d, climate was declared a major and imminent risk to the global economy, having wide environmental impacts, and increasing economic and societal divisions, inside countries and between regions.  \n\nCompanies are key players to introduce solutions and Stellantis is committed to bring a tangible impact on climate change. Stellantis has concerns that the climate emergency may be a threat to the operations of industrial and global companies like ours. Likewise, Stellantis is concerned that if nothing is done to correct the current climate situation, the rise in temperatures might drastically affect the environment including water, air and biodiversity, which may alter the ability to sustain human activities. Through challenging dialogues with stakeholders, such as investors, institutions, and NonGovernmental Organizations (NGOs), among others, Stellantis is refining its vision of carbon neutrality, its targets, its initiatives and solutions.  \n\nStellantis is committed to addressing the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to meeting the challenge of drastically reducing its carbon footprint. Stellantis is rethinking its value creation model to anticipate major trends.  \n\nClimate change requires a global response, which for Stellantis includes designing vehicles with lower ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq emissions, reducing the carbon impact of manufacturing facilities, logistics and purchasing and putting measures in place to offset any remaining carbon impact. Stellantis views it as an opportunity to be even more agile to face the challenges and to create the future of mobility, allowing for freedom of movement with reduced or no carbon emissions.  \n\nTo demonstrate its tangible commitments for a low-carbon economy, Stellantis has strengthened its climate governance by having climate change concern embedded in its decision-making processes and developed a holistic and ambitious strategy with the goal to reduce ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq emissions across its entire value chain.  \n\nStellantis also considers that growing awareness about upcoming climate changes for each and every individual is of the utmost importance. In this respect, Stellantis is providing free and easy access to a web-based Climate School with more than ten hours of training to its employees, in order for them to better understand the stakes and to get prepared for the necessary sustainable transformation of their activity. As of end-of-year 2023, more than 26,000 cumulated hours of training have been completed.",

It sheds light on how plants, soil and the oceans store and release carbon, how the global climate is responding to human influence, and the impacts of accelerating global warming: an increasingly variable water cycle, lasting changes in ocean and sea levels caused by the melting of the planet\u2019s ice caps, and more generally, extreme weather and climate events.  \n\nThe Sixth Assessment Report also highlights the importance of the choices we all make today. Therefore, its recommendations must inform the development and implementation of Stellantis\u2019 strategy.  \n\nIn its latest assessment on transport-related emissions, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that global ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions from cars and vans stood at 3.53Gt in 2022, slightly below the 2019 prepandemic high of 3.61Gt.

By 2030, Stellantis intends to sell $100\\%$ BEV for passenger cars in Europe and $50\\%$ BEV for passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S. \u25a0\t Stellantis has actively engaged with its suppliers to reduce the carbon footprint of purchased parts, led by an objective of reducing the carbon footprint of BEV purchased parts by $40\\%$ by 2030 (scope   \n3 Purchased goods and services of GHG protocol). This will allow us to reduce the carbon intensity of of battery and component production and further decrease our global carbon footprint reduction as we transition to electrified mobility.  \n\nThese objectives can be reached under the condition that the ecosystem adapts at the right pace and is conducive to electrification (public policies, charging infrastructure, decarbonized electricity, etc.).  \n\nStellantis anticipates to be compliant with the EU regulation that will impose only zero tailpipe emission passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2035. We are targeting to sell only BEV passenger cars in the EU by 2030.  \n\nIn the \u201cDaring for Zero\u201d series, involved employees present how they are delivering on this commitment and bringing the company closer to achieving its carbon net zero ambition $\\Delta^{9}$ .  \n\nComprehensive Carbon Net Zero roadmap including intermediate target of reduction by 2030 vs. 2021 (in intensity, tons ${\\mathsf{c o}}_{2}$ -eq per vehicle)  \n\nStellantis\u2019 2038 carbon neutrality commitment incorporates more than $90\\%$ reduction in emissions. For residual emissions that cannot be abated, Stellantis\u2019 position is to select carbon removal projects that strictly respect a set of robust quality criteria, which notably include additionality, no harm requirements for local ecosystems and communities, and environmental, social & biodiversity co-benefits.  \n\nWe are also closely monitoring the evolution of regulatory frameworks concerning best practices for carbon removal (revisions to Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement expected at COP 28, European Commission proposal on carbon removal \u2018QU.A.L.ITY\u2019 criteria), as well as leading science-based recommendations on carbon removal project quality.  \n\nConcurrently, Stellantis has engaged an in-depth screening of mature and emerging technologies - including Spot Source Capture, Direct Air Capture, Biochar, Mineral Storage, Reforestation & Afforestation etc. - to assess the most reliable and impactful carbon removal and storage technologies. Stellantis is committed to investing in a portfolio of carbon removal technologies and projects across several continents. Key orientations on this topic are planned to be submitted to the Strategy Council consistently with the timeline of decisions to be made for the Stellantis Carbon Net Zero roadmap.  \n\nIn the Spring of 2023 Stellantis Ventures made a strategic investment in NetZero, a climate venture specializing in long-term carbon removal from the atmosphere by turning agriculture residues into biochar, a very stable form of carbon. Biochar can be mixed with agricultural soils, improving yields and reducing the need for fertilizers 10.  \n\nStellantis computes its carbon footprint in accordance with Greenhouse Gas Protocol and consistently with ISO 14064 standard. Targets, covering absolute GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2 and Wellto-Wheel ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions from scope 3 in intensity, are established according to the available ScienceBased Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology at the time of roadmap definition, based on Sector Decarbonization Approach for the transport sector. The 2030 intermediate targets are in line with the Paris Agreement and $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ scenario.  \n\nThe consistency of Stellantis\u2019 approach with SBTi recommendations was verified in 2022 by EcoAct, a specialized firm in environmental analysis and greenhouse gas diagnostics. As SBTi is preparing its Draft Interim $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ Pathway for Automakers, Stellantis will revisit its assessment when an updated SBTi pathway is released.  \n\nTargets are defined assuming no change in the lifetime mileage of vehicles over the years. Nevertheless, we are working on improving vehicle durability.  \n\nImpacts on other environmental criteria of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are also taken into consideration $<6.1.7>$ .",

The policy elements are presented in $<6.3.2>$ .  \n\nStellantis is committed to actions that preserve the environment, by implementing initiatives that minimize energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Such initiatives include using alternative and renewable energy sources, supporting the purchase of energy-efficient products and services and designing manufacturing processes for improvements in energy performance.  \n\nThe analysis of our industrial and site ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ performance showed that the main emissions factors were:  \n\n\u25a0\t Energy consumption in the manufacturing plants (including processes and building systems) of which foundries and paint shops are main contributors \u25cf\t The electricity source type consumed by the manufacturing plants.  \n\nTherefore, Stellantis seeks solutions in its manufacturing processes that enable reductions in energy consumption, with a particular focus on decreasing the use of fossil fuels. This involves an energy management approach that notably maps the energy performance of all manufacturing plants and identifies the areas in need of improvement. This also involves associated short-term capital expenditure to reduce energy consumption. Another lever is to increase the share of energy use that comes from renewable sources to further reduce its carbon footprint.  \n\nStellantis\u2019 ambition is to implement green electricity on a broader scale. Therefore, Stellantis has signed contracts in Europe and United States for the installation of Photovoltaic and Wind parks which will operate on-site and off-site.  \n\nEnergy efficiency will play a key role in our strategy, the main levers to manage industrial greenhouse gas emissions are:  \n\n\u25a0\t Managing energy use in manufacturing activities  2.6.3   \n\u25a0\t Relying on low ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ energy sources $<2.6.3.1>$ attributed to: \u25cf\t Green Electricity contracts  2.6.3.2.1 \u25cf\t Green self-generated electricity projects  2.6.3.2.2  \n\nIn an effort to manage energy use, we are defining our joint Energy Management System which is an integral part of the implementation of the Stellantis Production Way $(\\mathsf{S P W})<6.3.3>$ . This managerial approach begins with an initial stage of staff involvement at all levels including the machine operator level, targeting the reduction of energy losses during non-production periods. The following stage consists of developing solutions to reduce consumption during production periods. As solutions are developed, best practices are shared and rolled out across the plants. Stellantis\u2019 environmental and energy management policies focus on methodologies and processes related to the optimization of energy use. At the end of 2023, the majority of Stellantis plants were ISO 50001 certified, representing approximately $74\\%$ of the Company\u2019s total energy consumption. The same percentage of consumption was certified in 2022. Accredited third parties certify the Company\u2019s Energy Management System. This management system supports our efforts to achieve a steady and consistent reduction in the environmental and energy impact of manufacturing processes.  \n\nThe attainment of Stellantis\u2019 Green Gas Emissions (GHG) reduction targets are founded on five fundamentals, which are already well-established:  \n\n\u25a0\t Being mindful of regulatory compliance and transparency in relationship with administration bodies   \n\u25a0\t Involving staff at all levels of the organization   \n\u25a0\t Rolling out an Energy Management System at the manufacturing sites, taking into account ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 requirements and recommending that suppliers maintain similar management systems   \n\u25a0\t Implementing production methods which incorporate the best practices that have adopted low cost and energy efficient processes from the design stage onwards, covering various aspects of production (logistics, maintenance, production)   \n\u25a0\t Employing shared best practices in these production methods to optimize consumption and emissions.  \n\nMain levers to reach Carbon Net Zero for scopes 1 and 2  \n\n```{table}\nPeriod\nShortterm2025, Energymanagementinallplants\nMediumterm2030, Energyefficientprojects Sitecompressionandimprovementofindustrialfootprint Useandproductionofrenewableenergies\nLongterm2038, [\u00b7Technicalinnovations(e.g.,Hydrogen,Power togas) CO2 capture and storage Compensationofresidualemissions]\n```",

The mutualization on single site multi brand activities or the intensification of the services activities on site, allows to reduce our footprint and to valorize our building by the renovation of our energy systems and the improvement of their control. \u25cf\t The works for the Creation of the mobility factory on our historic site Nanterre (France) have started. This unique concept integrates a dealership, sales to companies\u2019 activities, a megastore for used vehicles and a center for light commercial vehicles.  \n\n\u25a0\t The reconstruction of the Nanterre Dealership activity (France) allows to group four operational sites into one, and then the reduction of the surface by $59\\%$ . The work, completed at the end of 2023 allowed to demolish about 18,200 sq.m of old buildings, to build a new building of 3443 sq.m and finally to renovate external areas.  \n\n\u25a0\t The environmental requirement has been defined upstream of the project: decarbonized energy sources and energy performance better than regulatory thresholds ( $-30\\%$ versus requirements of the French thermal regulation 2012).  \n\n\u25a0\t The new building adopts a vegetable roof which helps improve quality of the air, reinforce the thermal insulation and the amount of ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ in the air and create habitats for biodiversity. Also to reduce the urban heat islands, we have provided around 10,000 sq.m of green space, 1,900 sq.m of evergreen to limit waterproofing on ground.  \n\n\u25a0\t In Italy, in 2023 the new Magliana dealership became a benchmark for environmental responsibility, with energy-efficient buildings labeled as A1, renewable energy from photovoltaic installation, electric paint shop, rainwater treatment, and water-recycling car wash.  \n\nHeating and cooling system are fully electric and the consumption are partially covered by PV installation that will provide electricity also to the charging stations available for customers. Also domestic hot water is powered by solar panels, meaning that this dealership operates without emitting any direct ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ .  \n\nThe building itself showcases energy efficiency through smart insulation, LED lighting, and intelligent climate control, all contributing to a sustainable atmosphere not only in the showroom but also in the workshop.  \n\nThe Electric Paint shop at this dealership represents a departure from conventional methods. By utilizing cutting-edge technology and renewable energy, the paint shop ensures minimal emissions and eliminates gas burners.  \n\nAll the rainwater of the external areas are collected, filtered and returned in the river.  \n\nEven the car wash embraces sustainability. The water recycling system is above ground and relocated here from another site. It will ensure that the washing water is treated, purified, and reused, significantly reducing water consumption. This eco-friendly practice exemplifies the dealership's commitment to responsible water management.  \n\nInto all the network \u201cStellantis Retail Division\u201d, a strong animation is deployed to implement actions in order to reduce the energy consumption and the carbon intensity, based on the two following pillars: Energy Sobriety and Efficiency \u2013 Use of low carbon sources.  \n\nKey figures to illustrate the optimization of energy consumption and ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ emissions in France:  \n\n\u25a0\t 910 kWp photovoltaic installed on 3 dealership on our Iberian area for our self consumption around 1,106 MWh/y and reduce 161 $\\mathsf{t C O}_{2}/\\mathsf{V}$   \n\u25a0\t Pursuit our LED plan for all the dealership and warehouse: 340 $\\mathsf{k}\\in$ for annual saving forecast of 479 MWh electricity   \n\u25a0\t Renovation heating equipment with low carbon energy instead of gas on three dealership in France: an investment of 790k\u20ac and an annual saving forecast of 373 tons of ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq  \n\nIn Poissy (France), R\u00fcsselsheim (Germany), and Mirafiori (Italy), Stellantis plans to develop so called \u201cgrEEn-campus\u201d for national headquarters that will serve as role models for Stellantis with low-carbon concept and extensive \u201cgreening\u201d by 2025.  \n\nThe objective of the \u201cgrEEn-campus\u201d is to renovate in an innovative and sustainable way the historic sites of Stellantis dedicated to automotive design, R&D and tertiary functions. The \u201cEE\u201d in grEEn-campus represents both Stellantis commitment to the Environment and the Employees: Energy positive to protect the Environment, as well as a mindset of constant Education to deliver a great Employee Experience.  \n\nFeasibility studies are ongoing to possibly extend this Green Campus development to other Stellantis historical main footprints.  \n\nThe redesign of the historic buildings, in combination with all other initiatives undertaken by Stellantis, contributes to the goal of becoming a carbon net zero corporation, all scopes included, by 2038, with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions. Once open, the renovated office buildings will be energy positive. In addition, renovated and existing buildings aim to be carbon neutral in use.  \n\nThese buildings will offer breakthrough energy and thermal performance through the:  \n\n\u25a0\t Integration of photovoltaic panels into the architecture   \n\u25a0\t Use of ultra-low-energy ventilation technology   \n\u25a0\t Reuse of materials aArchitectural choices to ensure environmental efficiency, resilience, and adaptability to climate evolution   \n\u25a0\t Generous green spaces, contributing to thermal regulation and human well-being.  \n\nThe initiatives implemented by Stellantis in 2023 resulted in an emission reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 for more than 120,000 tons of ${\\mathsf{c o}}_{2}$ -eq (versus 123,000 tons of ${\\mathbf{co}_{_{2}}}$ -eq in 2022) equals to 19.07 kg of ${\\mathsf{c o}}_{2}$ -eq/vehicle produced (versus 21.4 kg in 2022).  \n\nThe actions to control energy consumption led to savings of approximately $\\in60$ million (versus $\\in28$ million in 2022). These figures are included in the vehicle production costs and affect the Stellantis\u2019 overall economic performance.",

Changes in emission levels are thus directly related to changes in energy consumption and in energy sources. \\*Greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of biomass are not included in direct emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol guidelines. Direct GHG emissions expressed in tons of ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq are calculated by applying coefficients (global warming potential) of 298 for ${\\mathsf N}_{2}{\\mathsf O}$ and 21 for CH4 (source: IPCC reports, 2007 and 1995 respectively). Indirect (scope 2) emissions expressed in tons ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq. are calculated from electricity and steam purchases in compliance with emission factors obtained from suppliers for steam, based on the previous year\u2019s electricity factors, according to GHG Protocol Market-based guidelines. Location-based indirect (scope 2) emissions amounted to 1,997,962 tons of $\\mathsf{C O}_{2}.$ -eq. Fugitive emissions of ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ disclosed result to unintentional releases during the use of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.  \n\nThe data provided above has taken into account all emissions from all Stellantis industrial facilities including direct emissions from four cogeneration plants and has been calculated based on GHG Protocol standards.  \n\nThe Company uses energy produced by cogeneration plants managed by two different approaches. In Melfi Assembly Plant, Melfi Plastic, Cassino and Atessa (Italy), Sochaux, Rennes, Mulhouse and Hordain (France) plants have signed contracts with external suppliers which provide electricity, steam and hot water used in paint shop process. Three other cogeneration plants produce electricity and steam from gas. The energy produced is partly used in the plant, but a large part is also sold to other facilities or to external customers. The amount of gas used is 683,992 MWh HHV to produce 231,938 MWh of electricity and 233,027 MWh of steam. Electricity generated by cogenerations operated in R\u00fcsselsheim and Eisenach has a lower ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq content than the national electricity mix from the grid and therefore contributes to ${\\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ -eq reduction. These scope 1 emissions of the energy sold increase the reported absolute emissions even though they were not caused by the production.

Each month, HR representatives from about 30 countries participate in a poll and share information about working rhythms and atmosphere, manufacturing, engineering, sales, and Union activities and local policies.

The survey included open-ended comment boxes that allow employees to provide additional information. Participation in this survey is on a voluntary basis. The results are confidential as they are analyzed only in an aggregated form. Based on an employee-centric approach, the objective is to identify the strengths and improvements relative to the employee experience across the Company.  \n\nMore than 155,000 employees responded to the second edition of our Global Employee Survey conducted from May 9 to 31 representing a $63\\%$ participation rate, which is a 13-point increase compared with the first edition.  \n\nThe survey results showed a good level of motivation. For the question \u2018I am motivated to go beyond what is normally expected to help my Company be successful\u2019, $73\\%$ of the employees answered positively (versus $74\\%$ in 2022), demonstrating their strong commitment within the Company.\u00a0Employees clearly understand how their own job contributes to achieving the goals of the Company $83\\%$ of positive responses versus $84\\%$ in 2022).\u00a0They like their job, the kind of work they do $82\\%$ of positive answers versus $83\\%$ in 2022).

They consider that the Company is making the changes necessary to compete effectively in the market $68\\%$ of positive answers versus $70\\%$ in 2022).  \n\nOpportunity for improvement includes working conditions and workload, with answers varying by employee categories. There is also room to improve communication with the employees on matters affecting them. More than 7,000 managers received data dashboards for their areas to generate discussions within their team and define next steps in a collaborative mode. The main takeaways from the survey were shared with employees. As a result, local and team action plans have been implemented as well as regional wellbeing roadmaps. In communication, the link between actions and survey feedbacks were highlighted. Individual objectives for Human Resources and business teams were set with their actions and projects looking to improve wellbeing at work and motivation, thus decreasing absenteeism, and making Stellantis a great company to work for.\u00a0For example new setup for meetings, optimizing frequency, length and attendees and improvement of the facilities environment were topics raised by employees.  \n\nIn parallel, the local results of the survey were also shared with employee representatives in all the countries where Stellantis distributed the survey, with the goal to have a common and shared assessment as well as defining action plans for improving the social climate and the employees\u2019 engagement.  \n\nTo involve all employees in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, the Company is engaging in several actions:  \n\n\u25a0\t regular communications to all employees on the strategic orientations and steps of progress   \n\u25a0\t area dedicated to the strategic plan on the employee portal   \n\u25a0\t regular internal news publications highlighting concrete actions implemented   \n\u25a0\t learnings, webinars, masterclasses allowing the acculturation on key topics such as digital, software, D&I, electrification   \n\u25a0\t sharing and exchanges between managers and teams during managerial events such as divisional town halls and team meetings   \n\u25a0\t responding to questions raised relative to the strategic plan in the Global Employee Survey   \n\u25a0\t a numeric identity for blue collars will allow them to connect to The Hub, our intranet site, and a professional mailbox in order to directly receive all personalized communication. Blue collars will be involved in using digital collaborative tools in their daily jobs like chat, training or online documentation. The project was launched in 2023 with our strategic partner Microsoft.  \n\nAt the heart of the global Stellantis Human Resources policy to manage skills, we set up a worldwide and cross organization governance of 15 Stellantis global job families:  \n\n\u25a0\t Implemented 100 professions, with the proper governance, to identify strategic and key skills to support business performance   \n\u25a0\t Established the policy to map our employees in the global job families with a skills-driven approach   \n\u25a0\t Launched the technical skills rating process as a development perspective for our employees and business needs   \n\u25a0\t Defined the strategy to provide to employees the proper levers to act consistently in their development.

The CLPI is progressively being implemented in countries with no profit-sharing program. To the economic performance criterion of operating margin, a criterion on quality results has been added. In addition to this fixed and variable compensation, there is an individual bonus plan based on company, region or division and individual performance.  \n\nIn line with our co-constructive approach, agreements are communicated in different ways, also depending on local laws.

Stellantis was able to effectively mitigate the turbulence caused by the working stoppages through a comprehensive preparation plan, strong governance, and elite strategy. This allowed the company to navigate the challenges and minimize the impact on our operations, including the major strike in the US. It was triggered by the expiring of the Nationalnational agreement and UAW utilized their legal right to strike until a new agreement was found. The second major strike occurred in Italy and was declared by the trade unions to protest against the government for the lack of industrial initiatives and policies to support the revival of the metal sector in Italy. In total 76 strike events (versus 10 in 2022 and 13 in 2021) occurred corresponding to 136.5 days (versus 10.5 days in 2022 and 13 days in 2021).

Concerns are handled in accordance with the Stellantis Integrity Helpline - Whistleblowing Policy, applicable to all Stellantis companies and managed pursuant to local regulations.  \n\n\u25a0\t Each report is reviewed and when appropriate, triggers an internal investigation. The investigations are conducted with neutrality and respect in order to check and verify the facts. Behaviors that, after investigation, are concluded to violate our Code of Conduct can be subject to disciplinary measures that are proportional to the seriousness of the offense. Having an established reporting and case management system ensures that conduct or processes in violation of the Code can be detected promptly, thus limiting any potential negative impact on the Company and on its stakeholders.  \n\n\u25a0\t Any criticality arising from the concerns received are analyzed and specific corrective action plans implemented. Examples of action plans implemented arising from reports received that concluded in a violation of the company Code of Conduct include, revision of applicable procedures, assigned responsibilities and training deployed to reaffirm the expected standards of business conduct and behavior. Furthermore, a dedicated training, communication and awareness campaign was delivered to ensure that all employees are aware of how to behave to prevent the recurrence of such critical issues.

Based on the employee's performance, aspirations, leadership behaviors, technical skills and experience, managers and employees discuss potential next positions for the employee and discuss what it will take to get there.  \n\nBehavior and Values ratings based on our company values (Code of Conduct), which include management skills, are identified via an employee self-assessment of their strengths and focus areas, which is confirmed by their manager.  \n\nTechnical skills is another step dedicated to the key competencies of employees and their current and future employability within the Company. Technical skills libraries are identified by job families, referring to specific areas of employability called professions. The skill set includes a mix of skills needed to support both current employability and more strategic to enable our future.

The Leader Dynamics assessment allows a leader to complete a self-assessment of their leadership style, which is then contrasted with responses to those same questions by their direct/indirect team. Finally, the Team Dynamics assessment allows for teams to better understand how they function as a cohesive unit. Whichever assessment is utilized, all three provide insight that can be used to inform their development and future growth.  \n\nBy submitting the results for the annual appraisal the employee certifies that they have been achieved their results in compliance with the Stellantis Code of Conduct and that any potential Conflict of Interest was disclosed.",

In order to staff the new Software Division, a recruitment effort was deployed in five main hubs, U.S., India, Italy, France and Germany, to provide software critical skills from the global tech labor market. The hiring process started in July 2021 and allowed the onboarding of 300 newcomers, with the recruitment and onboarding of 761 new employees in 2022 and a further 619 in 2023. Furthermore, a Data and Software Academy was launched in 2022 to upskill and reskill over 1,000 Stellantis employees per year in software professions and reconvert internal existing talents into skills critical for the Company in the future. The Data and Software Academy ambition is to feed Software teams with Stellantis employees who would have been identified and upskilled or reskilled to become data analysts or software engineers. The academy is training thousands of data citizens to deploy the data driven strategy across all divisions to make sure every team is making the most of data and to improve our employees\u2019 employability by offering them new careers, certifications and new opportunities within the Company.  \n\nThe Data and Software Academy is also working on an innovative format to have content available 24 hours a day, seven days a week by developing a virtual 3D online academy that is slated to launch in 2024. The idea of the virtual 3D academy is to propose a place that is accessible, at any time, using innovative technologies with a metaverse approach integrating a virtual reality experience to complement the experience and provide the feeling of being together with the teacher and colleagues.  \n\nThe learning offers that would be accessible based on this platform include virtual classes, forums to exchange with peers, talks, online content or workshops. We want this online academy to be the flagship of the Academy and to embody the tech positioning Stellantis is taking. It is also an opportunity to test the use of a metaverse world to be able to be more comfortable with this technology and extend it to other fields later.",
